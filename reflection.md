Add your reflection here:
In the reflection document, reflect on which controls worked well for the games
and which did not. Why do you think this is? Where did some fall short in 
terms of our five interaction rules?

From the slides: "Interactions are not the same as our input devices, and 
instead are of the ways of interacting with the software." Throughout this 
lesson we have learned about the five themes for interacting and have now come
to realize, after working on this project, how important it is that new 
interactions need to be designed and *IMPROVED*. Our reflection for the 
different themes are as follows: 
1.) Thinking Through Doing
    Describes how the mind and body are connected to produce learning and 
    reasoning. Now, it should come as no suprise that through pysical 
    interactions we learn the best. That is why everyone was most comfortable 
    with using the keyboard--the typical a,w,s,d controls--to play the games. 
2.) Performance
    Now, performance describes the actions "our bodies are capable of . . . 
    and how the physical action can be both faster and nuanced." In short, we 
    can perform faster when we make things/design items to be extensions of 
    ourselves. Our brain sees the tools we use everyday as extensions of our 
    body. So, again, we are, as a group, able-bodied and have use keyboards for 
    eveyday things from a young age. Hence, we were most confortable using the 
    keyboard.
3.) Visibility
    Additionally, visibility describes the role of objects we use to aid us, 
    and how coordination can be easier when it is done visibly. That is to say,
    manipulation of visible objects helps us in coordination/production. Now, 
    while this is imperative in our day-to-day lives, it proved to be a 
    complete head ache using the mouse to control the characters in the game. 
    Perhaps its because we are not use to playing with only the mouse, or maybe
    its because the software is not to a point where one can easily manipulate 
    the character. 
4.) Risk
    Risk explores, in part, how digital interactions have mitigated risk in
    our lives. Now, while not one "game control" was better at versioning, they
    all allowed us to make changes and not be committed to a final result. 
    However, this project also did retain elements of risk in the fact that it 
    created the opportunity for more commitment; one of our group memebers was
    unable to get his camera working and, thus, proved the necessity of having 
    involvment from "all participants."
5.) Thick Practice
    Lastly, and one of the important take-aways: "We lose many of the salient 
    characteristics of items when we digitize them." You see, with the 
    invention of new tech, which 'they' call, "previously unavailable 
    functionality" comes with a whole list of problems. In sum, the keyboard 
    controls are the only game controls which did not cause problems. The color
    tracking was off unless the background was a solid white; the finger 
    tracking and voice recognition were laggy. 

Overall, new tech is supposed "to offer value that motivate their use even if 
face-to-face communication is available" but the head-aches we encounterd in 
implementing these controls were anything but motivational! The PC mouse may 
have went mainstream in the early 80's, but the history of the keyboard 
dates back to 1860's. We have a long way to go if you ask this group.
